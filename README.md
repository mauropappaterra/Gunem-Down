<h2 id="intro">The Game</h2>
Gun’em Down is a 3D never ending machine gun survival game. The player is
a machine gun nest that can rotate (but not move) 360 degrees, and shoots the approaching
hordes of enemies. Endless waves of monsters spawn in random corners of the screen and
attack the player. You can try to get a high score but as the apocalypse engulf the earth, you
know deep inside that there’s no way out alive on the game!
<br><br>
<h2 id="objectives">Game Objectives</h2>
Gun down as many creatures as you can, avoid being destroyed by the monsters as you strive
to survive. Use power ups to increase shooting speed and level up on your attack. There is no
way to win, but try to take down to hell with you as many monsters as you can.
