<h2 id="intro">Game Overview</h2>
Gun’em Down is a 3D, never ending, machine gun survival, horror themed game. The player object will be a machine gun nest that can rotate (but not move) 360 degrees, and shoot the approaching hordes of enemies. Endless waves of monsters will spawn in random corners of the screen and attack the player. You can try to get a high score but, as the apocalypse engulfs the earth, you know deep inside that there’s no way out alive on the game!

<h2 id="objectives">Game Objectives</h2>
Hell broke loose. Gun down as many creatures as you can, avoid being destroyed by the monsters as you strive to survive. Use power ups to increase shooting speed or upgrade your weapon, but be careful not to infuriate one dark deity that dwells in the jungle. There is no way to win, but you can try to take down to hell with you as many monsters as you can.
